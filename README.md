I definitely learned a lot during this project and honestly believed my coding skills have improved as I did my absolute best to go as far as I could before referecning anything for help (like randomly selecting the operators)
I found the timing counter interesting and wished I had dedicated more time to integrate the scoring system that gives you more points for taking less time. I think the random aspect for each problem was also pretty interesting fiddle with
