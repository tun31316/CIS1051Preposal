# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Text Adventure: Math

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A text adventure game that would have the user solve math problems to progress

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Using python I will create a text adventure game that uses code to randomly generate mathematic problems that the user has to solve in order to progress. I would use a health system so that If the user gets 3 or 4 problems wrong they would have to restart. The math problems would be laid out before hand but the components inside would be randomly picked. If I have time  would also like to add a scoring system that would create scores based on how quickly the problems are solved.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

The math problems would be functional and so would the health system

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The math problems would be more complex and also have varying levels of complexity randomly picked by the program. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The program would have the previously mentioned parts as well as a scoring system based on the time taken by the user and an incorporated story line

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I need to figure out how to cleanly implement branching pathways in the code as well as figure out how to add a timing/scoring system. I want to be able to have multiple paths that the user can follow based on whether they do the right thing or not or maybe even have the ability to choose a harder problem to progress faster so I need to research that and practice using smaller problems first. I am not working with any other classmates.
